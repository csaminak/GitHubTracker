# GitHubTracker

The purpose of this project was to create a simplified version of Github in order to practice using a build automation process and creating views in a Single Page Application using jQuery, Sass, and Bootstrap.

This app has a login page, the user's profile page, a page with all of their repositories, and a repository details page.

In order to run this app, follow these steps:
 - Clone the Application
 - run `npm install`
 - make sure bower is installed on your computer, if not not run `npm install -g bower`
 - run `bower install jquery`
 - run `grunt`
 - run `http-server build/`
 - In your browser you can go to localhost:8080 (or whatever your default port number is)
 Now the app is ready for you to test and change
